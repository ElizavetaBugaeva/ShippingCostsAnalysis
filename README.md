Overview

This repository contains the code for a Shipping Costs Analysis project designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) shipping-related data from invoice portals, map the data to orders, and analyze shipping margins. The project showcases my expertise in ETL processes, data analysis using Python, and the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to process and interpret invoice documents.

**Features:**
- GenAI for OCR: Leverages GenAI to extract text from scanned invoices, enabling the processing of non-digital inputs.
- Data Extraction: Automates the scraping of shipping and invoice data from multiple portals.
- Transformation & Cleaning: Cleans and normalizes the raw invoice data, preparing it for analysis.
- Loading: Outputs the cleaned data to a CSV format for further use.
- Order Mapping: Maps invoice data to orders, making it easier to calculate and assess shipping margins.
- Shipping Margin Analysis: Provides a breakdown of shipping costs, helping to identify areas for optimization.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python: Core language used for ETL processes and data analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data visualisation
- NumPy: Used in analysis for numerical operations.
- GenAI for OCR: Utilized to convert scanned invoices into structured text for further processing.
- CSV: Final output format for cleaned and transformed data.
